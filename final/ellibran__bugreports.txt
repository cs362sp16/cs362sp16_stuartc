Bug 1: Dominion Initialization not catching invalid input values
The initilization for a game of dominion didn't catch an invalid number of kingdom cards, or invalid players
selected such as -2 players. If game is taking in user input for determining the type of initialization then 
invalid input that is uncaught could result in an invalid game state later, not to mention a simply incorrect
version of dominion being played.

Bug 2:Random playing of entire game of dominion results in almost only negative scores
While this bug may be vague in scope, it still suggests some interesting invalid behavior within the scoring
of an entire game of dominion. There could be an issue within the scoreFor function not counting everything 
correctly, which would be easier to find. The harder fault to find from this observed bug would be if the game
in general was weighted much heavier for curses resulting in more negative scores, where as a real game would
have considerable trouble ending with a player in the negative region.

Bug 3: Specific card "minion" has an implementation that doesn't catch invalid choices
The minion card's implementation doesn't correctly check for a choice that is out of bounds. There should only
be two choices for playing minion, but a choice of "3" causes it to return 0 where it should have caught that
as an error and returned -1.
