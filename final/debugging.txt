One bug that was fixed within dominion was the minion card effect not catching invalid input for a choice. At first this seemed like there was a simple lack of an "if" statement
that would verify the input, however further investigation yielded a larger overall problem with the code as a whole. First I used gdb to step through the code where the effect
for the minion card was. While changing multiple different input variables and running the function, I still recieved the same undesirable outcome that the previous bad input
was giving. In fact, the second choice could never be chosen since the logical statements examined two inputs, one of which wasn't used. This was again varified by making
a small test program to compare the results with and it too showed the pretty clear logical problems with the inital input checking if statements. Overall, this problem was
mainly found by examining the source code, but then also throughly verified with a graphical debugger and some simple differential testing with a smaller, more correct, test
function.
