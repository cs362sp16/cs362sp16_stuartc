	Overall, after running the entire suite of function unit tests and card unit tests (that use the API)
there was 38% code coverage with six bugs detected. While this isn't the most through of testing efforts,
it was still effective considering the simplicity of designing tests and the effiecieny in creating them. 
More specifically, all of the unit tests focused in on testing specific aspects of functionality, some of them
quite critical to a normal playthrough of dominion. At the end of unit testing it is conclusive that a good 
amount of value can be gleaned from the output results, especially considering the relative ease and 
efficiency in creating the tests in the first place.
