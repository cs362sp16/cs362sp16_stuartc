After running my diffdominion bash script comparing the testdominion results between my dominion.c and another classmates, I finally found a version of dominon that my tester ran differently.
The difference ended up being in different errors that were caught in different areas. This process reinforces some of the difficulties of differential testing with a project of this size.
Ideally, differential testing would be done with a known "correct" program versus the one that is being tested, and this can usually be done only with smaller code segments. For dominion
there isn't really a "correct" version so all differential testing efforts are just done comparing between a version that works slightly differently than another (sometimes better sometimes worse).
The code coverage of this testing was quite high though, over 60%, which even if there was no "correct" version of dominion, there was still a lot of code that was covered and tested in two different
implementations. The differences in coverage between implimentations can indicate a version of dominion that is "worse" and may have bugs that prevent some code from ever running, but this isn't 
always the case.
