	After completing the suite of four unit tests there were five different bugs that were found.
The first two bugs were in the function "initializeGame" and were both related to invalid input into the
function. The first of the two was that the function didn't catch an invalid card selection in the set of 10
cards to play with. The second bug was that the function didn't catch that only 9 cards were given in a set, 
instead of 10. The next two bugs were in "scoreFor" and consisted of the function not failing from invalid card 
selection and not failing from invalid player selection input. The last bug was in "endTurn" where it continued
without failing when an invalid number of players was given as input.
